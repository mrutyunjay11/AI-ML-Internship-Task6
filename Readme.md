# Task 6 â€“ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project is my **Task-6 work** for KNN algorithm using Python.  
It check the dataset, normalize it, test many K values, and find which K give best accuracy.  
It also print confusion matrix, accuracy report, and show decision boundary graph for better understanding.

## What This Code Do

- Load **Iris dataset** from sklearn (already available)  
- Normalize feature values using StandardScaler  
- Split dataset into **train** and **test** part  
- Try multiple **K values (1 to 25)**  
- Find best K automatically based on accuracy  
- Plot **Accuracy vs K** graph  
- Train final model using that best K  
- Print accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- Show 2D **Decision Boundary** for 2 features (sepal length & width)  
- Display sample predictions for checking model output
